## TASK 1: 3D Printing
Worked with the 3D printer.A 3D model was taken from the internet and sliced using creality to convert the STL file to G-code which is understood by the printer 
.I learnt the jargons, 3D printing paramters and optimum conditions of the 3D printer.A boxing glove key chain was printed.

The Ultrasonic sensor holders were printed to mount the Sensor on the Chassis the STL file of the mount was sourced from the internet which was altercated using fusion 
360 to required parameters
